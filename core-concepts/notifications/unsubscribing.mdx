description: 'Stop receiving notifications for specific events'

**Unsubscribe** removes event handlers and stops receiving notifications for specific steps or events.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
// Unsubscribe from specific step event
connection.unsubscribe('step.success', 'order_placed');

// Unsubscribe from thread-level event
connection.unsubscribe('thread.completed');
```

```go Go
// Unsubscribe from specific step event
err := conn.Unsubscribe(ctx, "step.success", "order_placed")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Unsubscribe from thread-level event
err = conn.Unsubscribe(ctx, "thread.completed", "")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

### When to Unsubscribe

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Cleanup on shutdown** | Unsubscribe before closing connection |
| **Dynamic subscriptions** | Remove handlers no longer needed |
| **Memory management** | Prevent handler leaks in long-running processes |

### Behavior

- Removes event handler from client
- Stops receiving notifications for that event/step combination
- Server stops sending notifications if no active subscriptions remain
- Safe to call multiple times (idempotent)
