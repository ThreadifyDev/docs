### Acknowledging

**You must call `notification.ack()`** to confirm processing:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
connection.on('rule.violated', 'order_placed', async (notification) => {
  try {
    await processViolation(notification);
    notification.ack();  // ACK on success
  } catch (error) {
    // Don't ACK - notification redelivered after 30s (max 3 attempts)
  }
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### Retry Behavior

| Attempt | Delay | Action |
|---------|-------|--------|
| 1 | 0s | Initial delivery |
| 2 | 30s | First retry (if no ACK) |
| 3 | 30s | Second retry (if no ACK) |
| Failed | - | Moved to Dead Letter Queue |
