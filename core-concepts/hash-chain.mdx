title: Hash Chain
description: Cryptographically verified ordering and integrity for threads
---

The **Hash Chain** is a cryptographic verification system that ensures the integrity and ordering of steps in a thread. Each step contains a hash that links to the previous step, creating an immutable audit trail.

### Hash Properties

- **Tamper-proof** - Any modification breaks the chain
- **Ordered** - Ensures steps execute in correct sequence
- **Verifiable** - Chain integrity can be checked

Each step contains:
- **hash** - Current step's cryptographic hash
- **prevHash** - Previous step's hash (null for first step)

### Chain Verification

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Node.js">
```javascript
// Verify hash chain integrity
const archivedThread = await connection.getThread('thread-uuid');
const steps = await archivedThread.steps();

for (const step of steps) {
  if (step.verified) {
    console.log(`${step.stepName}: Verified ✓`);
  } else {
    console.error(`${step.stepName}: Chain broken`);
  }
}
```
</Tab>

### Benefits

- **Integrity** - Detects any modification to step data
- **Ordering** - Ensures steps execute in correct sequence
- **Audit Trail** - Immutable record of execution
- **Trust** - Cryptographic proof of execution

### Use Cases

- **Compliance** - Regulated industries need audit trails
- **Dispute Resolution** - Prove what actually happened
- **Security** - Detect unauthorized modifications
- **Debugging** - Identify where execution went wrong
