### Starting a Thread

A thread represents a workflow execution instance (e.g., an order, a support ticket).

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
const thread = await connection.start();
```

</CodeGroup>

### Recording Steps

Always create the step **before** executing business logic:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
const step = thread.step('order_received');

// Execute business logic
const order = await receiveOrder();

// Record success with context
await step.addContext({ orderId: order.id, total: order.total }).success();
```

</CodeGroup>

### Step Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `.success()` | Mark step as successful |
| `.success(data)` | Success with additional data |
| `.failed(data)` | Mark step as failed with error data |
| `.addContext(data)` | Add business context (analytics, debugging) |

### Idempotency

Threadify automatically handles idempotency - recording the same step multiple times only stores the first execution.
