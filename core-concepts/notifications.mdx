description: Real-time WebSocket events for reacting to execution changes
---

**Notifications** are real-time WebSocket events that allow your application to react to execution graph changes. Think of it as a pub/sub model where you subscribe to specific steps and event types, and your application receives events when those conditions occur.

### Event Types

#### Execution Events
- **step.success** - Step completed successfully
- **step.failed** - Step failed with error
- **step.error** - Step encountered system error

#### Validation Events
- **rule.violated** - Contract rule was violated
- **rule.passed** - Contract rule validation passed
- **rule.timeout** - Step exceeded time limit
- **rule.retry_limit** - Step exceeded retry limit

#### Thread Lifecycle
- **thread.completed** - Thread reached terminal state
- **thread.cancelled** - Thread was cancelled

### Subscription Model

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Node.js">
```javascript
// Subscribe to step execution events
connection.on('step.success', 'order_placed', async (notification) => {
  console.log('Order placed:', notification.context);
  
  // Get full thread context for decision making
  const thread = await connection.getThread(notification.threadId);
  console.log('Customer tier:', thread.refs.customerTier);
  
  notification.ack();
});

// Subscribe to validation violations
connection.on('rule.violated', 'inventory_check', (notification) => {
  console.error('Inventory violation:', notification.message);
  notification.ack();
});

// Contract-specific notifications
connection.on('rule.violated', 'product_delivery@order_placed', (notification) => {
  console.log('Contract violation detected');
  notification.ack();
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Event Processing

1. **Subscribe** - Register interest in specific events
2. **Receive** - Get real-time events via WebSocket
3. **Process** - Handle the event in your application
4. **Acknowledge** - Confirm receipt to prevent duplicates

### Use Cases

#### Real-time Monitoring
- **Operations dashboard** - Live view of process execution
- **Alert systems** - Notify teams of issues immediately
- **SLA monitoring** - Track performance in real-time

#### Automated Responses
- **Retry logic** - Automatically retry failed steps
- **Escalation** - Route critical issues to appropriate teams
- **Compensation** - Trigger rollback or recovery actions

#### Customer Experience
- **Status updates** - Provide real-time order status
- **Proactive support** - Contact customers about issues
- **Personalized notifications** - Custom alerts based on execution

### Best Practices

- **Acknowledge promptly** - Always call `event.ack()`
- **Handle gracefully** - Don't let notification failures break your app
- **Filter appropriately** - Subscribe only to relevant events
- **Error handling** - Catch and log notification processing errors
