title: 'Creating a Contract'
description: 'Define business rules and validation logic for your workflows'
---

**Contracts** define business rules and validation logic that enforce how steps should execute and relate to each other. They provide real-time validation and ensure business processes follow defined patterns.

### Contract Properties

- **Name** - Unique identifier for the contract
- **Version** - Supports contract evolution
- **Rules** - Validation logic for steps and transitions
- **Entry Points** - Valid starting steps
- **Terminal Steps** - Steps that complete the thread
- **Timeouts** - Maximum duration for steps and threads


### Contract Structure

<CodeGroup>

```yaml YAML
contract_name: order_fulfillment
version: 1
description: E-commerce order fulfillment workflow

# Entry points - where threads can start
entry_points:
  - order_placed

# Parties involved in the workflow
parties:
  - merchant
  - logistics

# Steps in the workflow
steps:
  - id: order_placed
    owner: merchant
    type: managed
    timeout: 5m
    business_context:
      required:
        - order_id
        - product_id
        - quantity
      optional:
        - customer_notes

  - id: inventory_checked
    owner: merchant
    type: managed
    timeout: 1m
    business_context:
      required:
        - in_stock
        - warehouse_id

  - id: shipment_created
    owner: logistics
    type: managed
    timeout: 24h
    business_context:
      required:
        - tracking_number
        - carrier_name

# Transitions define valid step flows
transitions:
  - from: order_placed
    to:
      - inventory_checked

  - from: inventory_checked
    to:
      - shipment_created
      - order_cancelled

# Terminal steps - where threads can end
terminal_steps:
  - order_delivered
  - order_cancelled

# Thread-level timeout
max_duration: 7d
```
