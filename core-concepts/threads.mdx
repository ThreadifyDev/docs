description: Complete business process executions in Threadify
---

A **thread** is a live execution graph that generates auditable logs alongside it. It's a live system of records that creates websocket events when things happen, either as a result of state changes or contract violations.

### Key Properties

- **Unique ID** for tracking and querying
- **Contract Governance** - Optional but tells Threadify what contract to use as actions are recorded into the graph
- **External references** (order IDs, customer IDs, etc.)
- **Complete execution history** with all steps and context
- **Cryptographic hash chain** for integrity verification

### Contract Governance

Threads can operate in two modes:

**1. Contract-Based Threads** (Recommended for critical workflows)
- Enforced by YAML contracts with validation rules
- Validates step transitions, required fields, and business rules
- Prevents race conditions and ensures compliance
- Identifies violations and sends WebSocket events for reactive handling

**2. Free-Form Threads** (For simple or exploratory workflows)
- No contract validation
- Full flexibility in step naming and sequence
- Useful for prototyping or non-critical processes

### Thread Content

Threads contain:
- **Steps** - Individual operations and their outcomes
- **Context data** - Payloads, metadata, and business information
- **Actors** - Services, users, or systems that perform actions
- **Timestamps** - When each action occurred
- **References** - Links to external system identifiers

### Thread-to-Thread Relationships

Threads can reference other threads to create complex execution graphs:
- **Parent threads** - Link to child threads for sub-processes
- **Child threads** - Reference parent threads for context
- **Related threads** - Connect parallel or dependent processes
- **Follow-up threads** - Link to original threads for continuations

### Contributors & Actors

Threads are built by various contributors:
- **Services** - Systems that record steps (web, backend, AI services)

### Use Cases

- **Order Fulfillment** - Track from order placement to delivery
- **Loan Applications** - Monitor from submission to approval/rejection
- **Insurance Claims** - Follow from claim filing to settlement
- **Customer Onboarding** - Track from signup to activation

### Example

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Node.js">
```javascript
// With contract validation
const thread = await connection.start('order_fulfillment', 'merchant');

// Without contract (free-form)
const freeThread = await connection.start(null, 'merchant');
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
