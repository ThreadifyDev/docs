description: Individual actions within Threadify threads
---

**Steps** are the individual actions or operations within a thread, representing specific parts of your business process. Each step captures the execution of a single operation with timing, context, and validation.

### Step Properties

- **Unique identifier** (step name + idempotency key)
- **Execution status** (success, failed, error)
- **Context data** (payload, metadata)

### Step Types

#### Terminal Steps
- Mark thread as complete when they succeed
- Example: "order_delivered", "loan_approved"

#### Regular Steps
- Part of normal execution flow
- Example: "payment_processed", "inventory_checked"

#### Retryable Steps
- Can be retried on failure
- Track retry count and attempt history

### Example

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Node.js">
```javascript
// Create step first, then execute business logic
const paymentStep = thread.step('payment_processed');
try {
  const payment = await processPayment(orderId);
  await paymentStep
    .addContext({ amount: payment.amount, transactionId: payment.id })
    .success();
} catch (error) {
  await paymentStep.failed({ 
    message: error.message,
    errorCode: 'PAYMENT_FAILED'
  });
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

- **Create step first** - Before executing business logic
- **Add context** - Include relevant data for debugging
- **Handle failures** - Always record failures with useful context
- **Use descriptive names** - Clear, action-oriented step names
