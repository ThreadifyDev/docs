## Welcome to Threadify

**Every customer request tells a story. Threadify captures it.**

Every order placed, claim filed, or application submitted flows through systems, APIs, approvals, and LLM agents. Threadify captures these flows and builds real-time execution graphs that enable better decisions for your teams, applications, and AI agents.

## What is Threadify?

Threadify builds real-time execution graphs from your application's execution flows. Instead of digging through logs for 45 minutes, query by customer ID, order number, or support ticket and get complete execution context in seconds.

**Key capabilities:**
- Build real-time execution graphs as flows happen
- Validate business rules in real-time
- Query by external IDs (order numbers, customer IDs, support tickets)
- Cryptographically verified audit trails
- Real-time notifications when execution changes
