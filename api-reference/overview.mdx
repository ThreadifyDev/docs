---

The Threadify GraphQL API provides powerful querying capabilities for thread execution data, validation results, and contract structures. Use it to build dashboards, analytics, and monitoring tools.

## API Endpoint

```
POST https://eng.threadify.dev/graphql
```

## Authentication

Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Query Complexity Limit

- **Maximum complexity:** 1000 points
- Each field costs 1 point
- List items multiply by their count
- Nested fields multiply by parent list size
- Use pagination to stay within limits

## Example Query

<CodeGroup>

```graphql GraphQL
query {
  thread(id: "thread-123") {
    id
    status
    contractName
    steps {
      stepName
      status
      latestContext
    }
  }
}
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://eng.threadify.dev/graphql \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "query { thread(id: \"thread-123\") { id status contractName } }"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Available Queries

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `thread(id)` | Get a single thread by ID |
| `threads(...)` | Search threads with filters |
| `threadsByContract(...)` | Find threads by contract |
| `threadsByRef(...)` | Find threads by external reference |
| `threadChain(rootId)` | Get thread relationship chain |
| `stepHistory(...)` | Get step execution history |
| `validationResults(...)` | Get contract validation results |
| `contractGraph(name, version)` | Get contract structure |
| `verifyThreadIntegrity(threadId)` | Verify hash chain integrity |
